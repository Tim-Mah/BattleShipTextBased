# BattleShipTextBased
Text based implementation of boardgame "Battleship"

2 player game, each tries to sink the other's naval fleet by guessing coordinates.
This game runs on the Java console and is text-based. Approx. 2 weeks of work.

# Limits

- Can only place ships upwards or rightwards (which still covers all ship placements, but may be mildly inconvenient.
- Console isn't cleared after each turn, it adds a lot of blank lines to appear blank. The entire game histry can be seen by scrolling up (and a way to cheat)

# Features
The game can be saved, and a game save file can be uploaded to resume playing.
Players can choose their names/nicknames (instead of being refered to as Player1 and Player2)
